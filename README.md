# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System
## About
Traffic sign classification is used to identify and distinguish between different types of traffic signs to forewarn and notify drivers of impending violations of the law. To develop the system, we implemented a deep neural network model that classifies traffic signs found within the image into distinct categories by utilizing Tensorflow and the Keras library. This model aims to improve upon existing systems by addressing issues like inaccurate predictions and high costs. 

By using this model we are able to analyze and interpret different traffic signs which is an essential prerequisite for all autonomous vehicles. 
Ultimately, it contributes to the development of autonomous vehicles that can effectively understand and respond to traffic signs.

## Dataset
We are using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Dataset from kaggle.

You can download the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

The dataset comprises more than 40,000 images of various traffic signs that are categorized into 43 distinct classes. The traffic signs are of numerous types, having many different backgrounds including different color variations which makes the model to perform more precisely.
